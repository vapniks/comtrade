This library contains the R code for using the comtrade API for downloading data.\\
Most of the code was copied from here: http://comtrade.un.org/data/Doc/api/ex/r, 
but having it packaged as a library is more convenient.

** Functions
| comtrade.codes | obtain codes for reporter and partner countries |
| comtrade.data  | download data from comtrade website             |
